            Bhagat Singh
        </summary>
        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
            Bhagat Singh (28 September 1907[1] – 23 March 1931) was an Indian anti-colonial revolutionary,[3] who
            participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in December 1928[4] in what was to be
            retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.[5] He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of
            the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic
            coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region, and after his
            execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.[6] Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and
            anarchism,[7] the charismatic Singh[8] electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted
            urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for
            India's independence.

        <h4>Early life</h4>
        <p>
            Bhagat Singh was born into a Punjabi Sikh family on 27 September 1907[1] in the village of Banga in the
            Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then British India and is today Pakistan; he was the second of
            seven children—four sons, and three daughters—born to Vidyavati and her husband Kishan Singh Sandhu.[17]
            Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh were active in progressive politics, taking part in the
            agitation around the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the Ghadar Movement of 1914–1915.

        <h4>Special Tribunal</h4>
        <p>
            To speed up the slow trial, the Viceroy, Lord Irwin, declared an emergency on 1 May 1930 and introduced an
            ordinance to set up a special tribunal composed of three high court judges for the case. This decision cut
            short the normal process of justice as the only appeal after the tribunal was to the Privy Council located
            in England

            Vallabhbhai Patel
        </summary>
        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
            Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel ISO: Vallabhabhāī Jhāvērabhāī
            Paṭēla; 31 October 1875 – 15 December 1950, commonly known as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,[a] was an Indian
            independence nationalist and barrister who served as the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of
            India from 1947 to 1950. He was a senior leader of the Indian National Congress, who played a significant
            role in the country's struggle for independence and its political integration.[1] In India and elsewhere, he
            was often called Sardar, meaning "Chief" in Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Persian. He acted as the Home Minister
            during the political integration of India and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947

        <h4>Fight for independence</h4>
        <pre>
            Patel , supported by Congress volunteers Narhari Parikh, Mohanlal Pandya, and Abbas Tyabji, Vallabhbhai Patel began a
            village-by-village tour in the Kheda district, documenting grievances and asking villagers for their support for a
            statewide revolt by refusing to pay taxes. Patel emphasised the potential hardships and the need for complete unity and
            non-violence in the face of provocation response from virtually every village.[25] When the revolt was launched and tax
            revenue withheld, the government sent police and intimidation squads to seize property, including confiscating barn
            animals and whole farms. Patel organised a network of volunteers to work with individual villages, helping them hide
            valuables and protect themselves against raids. Thousands of activists and farmers were arrested, but Patel was not. The
            revolt evoked sympathy and admiration across India, including among pro-British Indian politicians. The government
            agreed to negotiate with Patel and decided to suspend the payment of taxes for a year, even scaling back the rate. Patel
            emerged as a hero to Gujaratis.[26] In 1920 he was elected president of the newly formed Gujarat Pradesh Congress
            Committee; he would serve as its president until 1945.[citation needed]
            
            Patel supported Gandhi's Non-cooperation movement and toured the state to recruit more than 300,000 members and raise
            over Rs. 1.5 million in funds.[27] Helping organise bonfires in Ahmedabad in which British goods were burned, Patel
            threw in all his English-style clothes. Along with his daughter Mani and son Dahya, he switched completely to wearing
            khadi, the locally produced cotton clothing. Patel also supported Gandhi's controversial suspension of resistance in the
            wake of the Chauri Chaura incident. In Gujarat, he worked extensively in the following years against alcoholism,
            untouchability, and caste discrimination, as well as for the empowerment of women. In the Congress, he was a resolute
            supporter of Gandhi against his Swarajist critics. Patel was elected Ahmedabad's municipal president in 1922, 1924, and
            1927. During his terms, he oversaw improvements in infrastructure: the supply of electricity was increased, drainage and
            sanitation systems were extended throughout the city. The school system underwent major reforms. He fought for the
            recognition and payment of teachers employed in schools established by nationalists (independent of British control) and
            even took on sensitive Hindu–Muslim issues.[28] Patel personally led relief efforts in the aftermath of the torrential
            rainfall of 1927 that caused major floods in the city and in the Kheda district, and great destruction of life and
            property. He established refugee centres across the district, mobilised volunteers, and arranged for supplies of food,
            medicines, and clothing, as well as emergency funds from the government and the public.
